I am a **software engineer**, with experience in both web and mobile software development. Although I work more than 5 years in the IT industry I still consider myself a student.

It seems to me that over the years I have learned the most important skill for programmers - *the ability to solve problems*, despite the complexity and in what language it is written. However my favorite programming languages are `Swift` and `Javascript`.

I am currently working as a freelance software developer and I am always interested in new challenging projects.

Looking forward to work with you! Reach out to [my email](mailto:email@example.com).
